# Organize Pages

Open a PDF, then choose **Organize pages** in All tools. Click thumbnails, Ctrl+click individual pages, Shift+click a range, or enter a range such as `1-3, 5` and press Select.

**Combine Files** is a separate All tools command. With two distinct PDFs open, choose the first and second document; it writes a new copy containing their current edited pages in that order. The first PDF’s Info/XMP metadata is retained without merging or inventing metadata. Both source tabs, including unsaved edits and history, stay unchanged.

**Insert pages** is available from Organize Pages. Choose distinct target and donor PDFs, then a boundary from 0 before the target’s first page through its page count after the last page. The new copy contains the target prefix, every current edited donor page, then the target suffix. The target PDF’s Info/XMP metadata is retained; both source tabs stay unchanged.

**Replace pages** is available from Organize Pages. Select one contiguous target range, choose a distinct donor PDF, and save a new copy. The new copy contains the target prefix, every current edited donor page, then the target suffix. The target PDF’s Info/XMP metadata is retained even when the selected range is the whole target; both source tabs stay unchanged.

Available commands:
- Rotate selected pages clockwise/counterclockwise.
- Delete selected pages with confirmation. At least one page must remain. Undo restores deletion.
- Move one selected page earlier or later. In the source build, enter a final position in **Move to page** and press **Move** or Enter to jump directly there. For example, moving page 1 to position 6 makes it the sixth page; the moved page stays selected. Undo restores the previous order.
- Extract selected pages into one new PDF in document order.
- Crop one or more selected physical pages. Organize Pages starts on the page you were viewing; enter finite, non-negative top, right, bottom, and left insets in points. The same amounts apply independently to each page’s current displayed visible bounds, including its current rotation and prior crop. The preview shows one exact size for uniform pages or width/height ranges for mixed sizes or rotations; that mixed preview is dimensional only. Every page must retain at least 1 point in each dimension. Native validates all targets before one undoable change or no change. Cropping hides content and is not redaction.
- Reset crop on one or more selected physical pages. This directly removes only crop edits made in the open session. A mixed selection changes the cropped members in one undoable edit; if none has a session crop, the result is neutral and leaves the revision, history, and redo branch unchanged. It makes content hidden only by those session crops visible again, but cannot reveal content outside original or inherited source crop/page boxes, including a crop stored in a reopened PDF. Rotation and annotations remain unchanged.
- Split the current edited page order into fixed-size files. Enter a positive whole number of pages per file; the preview limits the operation to 64 output files. Windows asks for a new output folder, and canceling that dialog leaves the document unchanged.
- Insert every current edited page from a distinct open donor PDF into a new target copy. Choose the insertion boundary before the first page, between pages, or after the last page. Windows asks where to save the new PDF; canceling leaves both source documents unchanged.
- Replace one contiguous target range with every current edited page from a distinct open donor PDF. The preview shows the selected range and resulting page count. Windows asks where to save the new PDF; canceling leaves both source documents unchanged.
- Undo/redo page operations. A new edit after undo clears the redo branch.
- Save a Copy of the complete working document. Existing files cannot be overwritten. Canceling the file picker leaves edits intact.

Edits remain in memory until saved. Source PDFs are never overwritten. A copy save clears the working document's unsaved indicator; extraction does not. Closing a tab or window with unsaved edits prompts before discarding.

Native extraction output is validated for PDFium readability and page count, written to a temporary file, flushed, and atomically published at a new filename. Split output validates every file in a staged folder before atomically publishing that new folder; existing folders are never replaced. Strict app-owned sticky notes and area highlights move with their pages through supported move, delete, extract, and split operations. Combine, Insert Pages, and Replace Pages validate both current source plans and every new output before publishing a new file without replacement; they refuse annotated sources and unsupported catalog/page-tree features, cap aggregate input at 4,096 pages and serialized output at 256 MiB, retain the first/target PDF’s Info/XMP metadata, and leave both source sessions unchanged. These limits protect output creation; they are not application memory caps. The original source bytes are frozen at open; splitting uses the current edited page order but does not clear the unsaved indicator, alter the save baseline, or change undo/redo history.

Limitations:
- Signed/certified/encrypted files are not edited.
- Structural changes to forms, tagged documents, page labels, and article threads are rejected.
- Removing/extracting pages with bookmarks, destinations, names/attachments, or open actions is rejected until those references can be maintained safely. Foreign or unrecognized annotations are also rejected; fully validated app-owned sticky notes are preserved by supported operations.
- No page-label editing or label-based ranges, page boxes, drag-reorder, or one-file-per-extracted-page yet.
- Thumbnail cards are all present in the grid; only nearby thumbnails are rasterized. No measured real-document performance claim.
- Native desktop interaction for Reset crop remains unverified.

Verification: Reset crop focused UI coverage checks sorted physical requests, label independence, neutral no-op, changed-result selection retention, malformed/stale errors, retry, and busy/duplicate guards. The full frontend suite passed 199 tests across 43 files, and the production frontend transformed 1,936 modules in 2.38 seconds. Its local mocked-browser harness submitted `{id:42,revision:7,pages:[0,3]}`, retained the selected rows for neutral and changed results, and had no browser errors; it does not prove native desktop interaction. The focused native three-test corpus gate and independent artifact review passed. The full native gate passed 167 tests with 0 failures and 1 ignored test in 332.24 seconds. The standalone debug/no-bundle build exited 0 with 1,936 frontend modules in 2.28 seconds and native code in 13.84 seconds; its 30,197,760-byte executable SHA-256 is `FA558EA1C897EF0D7EF66765B7A87A25B0581F1611F8D98367EAA4DE05E79FAD`, with exact current `index-CE5_RcSi.js`, CSS, and transformed HTML Brotli bytes verified embedded. Earlier replacement, Combine, Insert, Split, and batch-crop evidence remains as recorded in the repository history.

Standalone desktop verification: opened the sample, displayed six rendered thumbnails, rotated page 1 to landscape, and saved through the native Save dialog to `artifacts/ui-organized-copy.pdf`. The 6,897-byte output exists and the application reported successful save and cleared its unsaved indicator.

Native folder-dialog interaction for splitting, native crop interaction, and native save dialogs for Combine Files, Insert Pages, and Replace Pages remain unverified in the desktop application.
